Hi! I am an applied microeconomist interested in labor and gender. In December 2024, I joined the Indeed Hiring Lab as an Economist. 

I use Indeed's job posting, resume, and other data to research global labor market trends and lead all work on the German labor market.

I am affiliated with DIW Berlin, where I wrote my PhD thesis on the impact of women in management on labor market and firm outcomes. 

I co-founded [The Women in Economics Initiative](https://www.women-in-economics.com/), a not-for-profit organisation working on gender and diversity in the economics profession, which I led until October 2024.
