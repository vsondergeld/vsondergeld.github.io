Hi! I am an applied microeconomist interested in gender and labor. I am currently a PhD candidate in economics at the Berlin School of Economics and FU Berlin and Research Associate at the German Institute of Economic Research (DIW Berlin). 

In my research, I use econometrics, experimental methods and text-as-data to study how women in leadership positions affect labor market and firm outcomes and how they are perceived.
