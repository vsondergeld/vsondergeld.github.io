The Women in Economics Initiative (WiE) was founded in 2019 with the goal of encouraging equal opportunity and a balanced representation of genders in the economics profession across the academic, private and public sectors.

As one of its co-founders, I led WiE for five years until handing over the chair position to my colleague and friend Jelena in October 2024. I continue to contribute to the organization as an advisory board member.

WiE hosts a monthly Brown Bag Seminar Series on the first Friday of every month during lunchtime (12-1pm CET). Find out about upcoming speakers and sign up for our mailing list [here](https://www.women-in-economics.com/brownbagseminarseries).
