The Women in Economics Initiative (WiE) was founded in 2019 with the goal to encourage equal opportunity and a balanced representation of genders in the economics profession across the academic, private and public sectors.

As one of its co-founders, I led WiE for five years until handing over the chair position to my colleague and friend Jelena in October 2024.
